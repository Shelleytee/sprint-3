What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550px?
  Everything on the page stacks under each other as opposed to alongside each other. This is done through media queries within css.

How do you think that works?
  By defining the min/max screen widths the content layout is re-formatted for smaller to larger screen displays. A media query defines a screen display size and once that size has been reached it activates or runs a selection of different css elements that are declared specifically for when that screen size is used by a device.
